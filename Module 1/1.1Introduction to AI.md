### **Artificial Intelligence (AI) â€“ Revision Notes**

### **1\. What is AI?**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, allowing them to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

### **2\. Types of AI**

AI is categorized into three types based on its capabilities:

#### **A. Narrow AI (Weak AI)**

*   Designed for specific tasks.
    
*   Cannot perform beyond its programmed function.
    
*   Most AI systems today are Narrow AI.
    
*   **Examples:** Chatbots (ChatGPT, Siri), Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube), Image recognition.
    

#### **B. General AI (Strong AI)**

*   Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task like a human.
    
*   Capable of reasoning, problem-solving, and learning from experience.
    
*   Not yet achieved.
    
*   **Example:** AI with human-like cognitive abilities (e.g., sci-fi AI like J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man).
    

#### **C. Super AI**

*   Theoretical AI that surpasses human intelligence.
    
*   Capable of independent decision-making and innovation.
    
*   Poses ethical and existential concerns.
    
*   **Example:** AI controlling governments or outperforming humans in every field (Sci-fi concept).
    

### **3\. Augmented Intelligence**

*   **Definition:** Augmented Intelligence is the use of AI to enhance human decision-making rather than replace it.
    
*   AI acts as a supportive tool, helping humans analyze data, detect patterns, and make informed choices.
    
*   **Examples:**
    
    *   **Healthcare:** AI assists doctors in diagnosing diseases but doesnâ€™t replace them.
        
    *   **Finance:** AI detects fraud, but human analysts verify it.
        
    *   **Customer Support:** AI chatbots handle basic queries, while humans address complex issues.

### **4\. Other Important AI Concepts**

#### **A. Machine Learning (ML)**

*   A subset of AI where machines learn from data without explicit programming.
    
*   **Example:** Spam detection, recommendation systems.
    

#### **B. Deep Learning (DL)**

*   A subset of ML using neural networks to process large datasets.
    
*   **Example:** Image recognition, speech recognition.
    

#### **C. Generative AI**

*   AI that creates new content (text, images, music, etc.).
    
*   **Examples:** ChatGPT (text generation), DALLÂ·E (image generation).

### **ðŸ”¹ Summary:**

*   **AI** enables machines to mimic human intelligence.
    
*   **Types of AI:**
    
    *   **Narrow AI** (Task-specific, like Alexa).
        
    *   **General AI** (Human-level intelligence, still theoretical).
        
    *   **Super AI** (Beyond human intelligence, hypothetical).
        
*   **Augmented Intelligence** enhances human decision-making using AI.
    
*   **Key AI Concepts:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative AI.
