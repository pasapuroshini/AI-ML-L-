AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be understood in **four different ways** based on how it thinks and acts.

### 1\. **Thinking Like a Human (Copying Human Thought)**

*   This approach tries to make computers **think the way humans do**.
    
*   It studies how people **solve problems, make decisions, and learn**, then tries to copy that in a machine.
    
*   Example: Scientists study how the human brain works and use that knowledge to build AI.
    

### 2\. **Thinking Logically (Following Rules of Thought)**

*   This approach makes AI **follow strict logical rules**, like math formulas, to make decisions.
    
*   It does not try to copy how humans think but focuses on **correct reasoning**.
    
*   Example: AI that solves puzzles or proves math theorems.
    

### 3\. **Acting Like a Human (Imitating People)**

*   This approach focuses on making AI **act like a human**, even if it doesn’t think like one.
    
*   AI passes a test (like the **Turing Test**) if a human **can’t tell if it's a machine or a person**.
    
*   Example: Chatbots like **ChatGPT, Siri, and Alexa**, which talk like humans.
    

### 4\. **Acting Logically (Making the Best Decision)**

*   This approach makes AI **act in the best possible way** to solve a problem, even if it doesn’t think like a human.
    
*   It focuses on **doing the right thing** based on available information.
    
*   Example: **Self-driving cars, Google Search, and chess-playing AI** that make the best moves.
    

Modern AI usually **combines** these approaches to work better.

## 1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach

The **Turing Test**, created by **Alan Turing in 1950**, is a way to check if a computer is truly intelligent.

### **How Does It Work?**

*   A human asks questions through a computer.
    
*   The answers can come from **either a human or a computer**.
    
*   If the human **can’t tell which one is the computer**, the AI passes the test.
    

### **What Skills Does an AI Need to Pass?**

To successfully trick a human, the AI must be able to:

1.  **Understand and use language (Natural Language Processing)** – AI must **read, write, and respond** like a human.
    
2.  **Store and remember facts (Knowledge Representation)** – It needs a **memory** of what it learns.
    
3.  **Think and make decisions (Automated Reasoning)** – AI should use **logic** to solve problems.
    
4.  **Learn and improve (Machine Learning)** – It should **learn from experience** and find patterns.
    

### **The "Total" Turing Test**

*   The original test only checked for **text-based intelligence**.
    
*   The **Total Turing Test** adds **visual and physical** tasks, requiring AI to:
    
    *   **See and recognize objects (Computer Vision)**
        
    *   **Move and interact with objects (Robotics)**
        

### **Why AI Researchers Don’t Focus on the Turing Test**

*   Instead of just **imitating humans**, researchers want AI to be **useful** and **intelligent** in its own way.
    
*   Just like airplanes don’t **flap their wings** like birds, AI doesn’t need to **act exactly like humans** to be smart.
    

### **Conclusion**

The Turing Test is still important, but AI research today focuses on **making AI powerful and practical**, rather than just fooling people.









### Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach


To say a computer **thinks like a human**, we need to understand **how humans think**. There are **three main ways** to study this:

1.  **Introspection** – Observing our own thoughts as they happen.
    
2.  **Psychological Experiments** – Watching how people behave in different situations.
    
3.  **Brain Imaging** – Using technology (like MRI scans) to see what happens inside the brain.
    

### **How Does This Help AI?**

*   If scientists **understand how humans think**, they can create **computer programs** that work the same way.
    
*   A program is considered a good model of human thinking if its **thought process (step by step reasoning) is similar to a human's**.
    

### **Example: The General Problem Solver (GPS)**

*   Developed by **Allen Newell and Herbert Simon** in 1961.
    
*   It was not just designed to **solve problems** but to **think like a human** while solving them.
    
*   Researchers compared how the **AI reasoned** vs. how **humans reasoned** when solving the same problem.
    

### **Cognitive Science: The Link Between AI and Psychology**

*   **Cognitive Science** combines AI and psychology to study human intelligence.
    
*   It helps AI researchers build **better models of thinking** based on real human behavior.
    
*   For example, **computer vision** (how AI sees images) uses **knowledge from neuroscience** about how the human brain processes images.
    

### **Why Separating AI and Cognitive Science is Important**

*   In the past, researchers assumed that **if an AI program performed well, it must be thinking like a human**.
    
*   Now, scientists understand that **AI can be good at solving problems without thinking like humans do**.
    
*   This **separation** has helped both **AI and cognitive science** grow as independent fields.
    

### **Conclusion**

Cognitive science helps AI researchers create **human-like intelligence**, but **AI doesn’t always need to think like a human to be effective**. AI can be designed in **different ways** to solve problems, sometimes even better than humans!







This approach is based on **formal logic**, which means following strict **rules of reasoning** to reach correct conclusions.

### **Origins: Aristotle and Logical Thinking**

*   **Aristotle** (a Greek philosopher) was one of the first to define **how humans should think logically**.
    
*   He introduced **syllogisms**, which are logical rules like:
    
    *   **Example**:
        
        1.  **Socrates is a man.**
            
        2.  **All men are mortal.**
            
        3.  **Therefore, Socrates is mortal.**
            
*   This kind of reasoning was meant to **ensure that conclusions are always correct if the given facts are correct**.
    
*   This led to the development of **logic**, the foundation of mathematical reasoning.
    

### **Logic in AI**

*   In the **19th century**, logicians created **a precise way to describe relationships** between objects, not just numbers (like in arithmetic).
    
*   By **1965**, AI programs were created that could **solve problems using logical rules**.
    
*   The **logicist approach** in AI aims to build **intelligent systems** that **reason logically** to make decisions.
    

### **Challenges of the Logical Approach**

1.  **Difficult to Convert Real-World Knowledge into Logic**
    
    *   Human knowledge is often **uncertain or vague**.
        
    *   Logic requires **100% clear and precise** rules.
        
    *   Example: "It is likely to rain tomorrow" is **not a strict logical statement**.
        
2.  **Computational Limitations**
    
    *   Even a **small number of logical rules** can make a problem too **complex** for computers to handle.
        
    *   AI needs **smart ways** to decide which logical steps to follow first.
        
    *   Otherwise, it might **get stuck trying all possibilities**, which is **too slow** for real-world applications.
        

### **Conclusion**

*   The **"laws of thought"** approach is useful for building **logic-based AI**.
    
*   However, **real-world problems** often require handling **uncertainty and complexity**, which makes pure logical reasoning difficult.
    
*   AI today **combines logic with other techniques** (like **machine learning**) to be more effective.




### **Acting Rationally: The Rational Agent Approach**

#### **What is an Agent?**

*   An **agent** is something that **acts** (the word comes from the Latin _agere_, meaning _to do_).
    
*   All computer programs **do something**, but an **AI agent** is expected to:
    
    1.  **Operate autonomously** (work without human help).
        
    2.  **Perceive its environment** (understand what’s happening around it).
        
    3.  **Persist over time** (continue working, not just run once).
        
    4.  **Adapt to change** (learn and improve).
        
    5.  **Have goals and try to achieve them**.
        

#### **What is a Rational Agent?**

*   A **rational agent** is an agent that always tries to do the **best** thing in any situation.
    
*   If there is **uncertainty**, it chooses the action that gives the **best expected outcome**.
    

#### **How is this Different from the "Laws of Thought" Approach?**

*   The **"Laws of Thought"** approach focused on **correct reasoning** (logic).
    
*   Rational agents **use logic**, but they also act **even when there is no perfect answer**.
    
*   Example:
    
    *   A **robotic vacuum cleaner** does not need to **prove mathematically** that one path is the best.
        
    *   It just **chooses a good path** based on its sensors and starts cleaning.
        

#### **Why is the Rational-Agent Approach Better?**

1.  **More General**
    
    *   Logical reasoning is **only one way** to act rationally.
        
    *   Some actions (like pulling your hand away from fire) **do not involve logical thinking** but are still rational.
        
2.  **More Scientific**
    
    *   Rationality can be **mathematically defined** and used to design AI systems.
        
    *   Human behavior is **complex and inconsistent**, so AI researchers focus on **rational actions** instead of copying humans exactly.
        

#### **Challenges of Perfect Rationality**

*   In complex situations, **always making the best choice** is **impossible** because:
    
    1.  There is **too much information** to process.
        
    2.  The **environment changes too quickly**.
        
    3.  Some decisions must be made **immediately**.
        
*   **Solution**: AI uses **limited rationality**, meaning it makes **the best decision possible** within **time and resource constraints**.
    

### **Conclusion**

*   The **rational-agent approach** is **the best way** to build AI.
    
*   Instead of just **thinking correctly**, AI **acts in a way that achieves good results**.
    
*   This approach is **scientific, practical, and scalable**, making it the **foundation of modern AI**.
